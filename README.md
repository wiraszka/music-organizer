# Functionalities to add:

**1) audio-file-fixer.py**
- fill in title and artist tags from filename if none present
- fix issue with 'None' (string) vs null
- handle foreign keyboard characters


**2) spotify-lookup.py**
- download album cover
- get bpm for songs (either through analyzing wave file or scraping info)
- get key for songs
- get genre for songs
- add search sequence to search multiple times with different combos of tags
-


**Other ideas**
- add shazam (waveform comparison) functionality if possible
- incorporate youtube API search into matching to make it more accurate and deal with lesser known songs
-
- suggest recommended songs based on songs already analyzed (maybe using AI, training a neural net)
